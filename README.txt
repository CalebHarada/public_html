Hi! I'm Caleb Harada. Welcome to my personal website.

I'm an astrophysics Ph.D. student and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at UC Berkeley. My research focuses on the dectection and characterization of extrasolar planets. I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Maryland, College Park, before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area for my Ph.D. I work on a variety of problems in exoplanetary science ranging from 3D simulations of cloudy hot Jupiters to modeling exomoon transits in noisy datasets. When I'm not thinking about astronomy, I enjoy hiking, birding, admiring my cat, and exploring the produce section at Berkeley Bowl.
My pronouns are they/them.
