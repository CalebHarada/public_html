										The Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26141/pathways-to-discovery-in-astronomy-and-astrophysics-for-the-2020s" target="_blank">"Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics"</a> (Astro2020) has 
										recommended that NASA realize a large IR/O/UV space telescope optimized for high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of ~25 exo-Earths and transformative general astrophysics. The NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) has subsequently released a 
										<a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/2645_NASA_ExEP_Target_List_HWO_Documentation_2023.pdf" target="_blank">Mission Star List</a> consisting of 164 nearby targets deemed the most accessible to survey for potentially habitable exoplanets with 
										the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Precursor studies of promising targets for the future HWO exo-Earth survey are necessary to reduce mission design risk by enabling science and engineering trades that weigh how key design choices and astrophysical realities 
										impact the yield of potentially habitable planets characterized by HWO. Identifying and characterizing the most promising targets early on in mission development will inform critical mission requirements (e.g., inner/outer working angle, field of regard, 
										sensitivity, settling time, slew speed, wavelength coverage, etc.) and facilitate target selection later on in the mission design process. I'm working to identify and improve our understanding of the most promising targets for HWO as part of the HWO 
										<a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/spores-hwo/" target="_blank">Stellar Properties & Observational Reconnaissance for Exoplanet Studies</a> (SPORES) collaboration.

									<p><span class="image left"><a href="res-exomoons.html"><img src="images/research.jpg" alt="Artist's impression of an exomoon orbiting a giant planet"></a><em>Illustration: NASA/JPL-Caltech</em></span>
										Exomoons are the hypothesized natural satellites of exoplanets, which may hold clues about planet formation, migration,
										and habitability. Exomoons orbiting temperate giant planets (i.e., planets that are orbiting near the "habitable zone"
										of their host stars, but are too gas- or volatile-rich to have a habitable surface) are particularly interesting because
										they are predicted to be stable over long periods of time and could, in principle, support life. Temperate exomoons
										could dramatically expand the range of "habitable" environments beyond the Solar System, especially considering the tantalizing
										prospect of icy moons in the outer Solar System being amenable to life. To date, no exomoon detections
										have been confirmed due to both the low expected signal-to-noise and astrophysical systematic
										uncertainties like stellar variability. Nonetheless, theoretical studies of exomoon stability can place important limits
										on what we may expect to observe in temperate Jovian systems in the future with more precise technology, as well as informing
										uncertainties in ultra-precise measurements of exoplanet systems.

										Multiplanet systems are highly valuable for studying the physics governing planet formation 
										and evolution, but many of the multiplanet systems discovered prior to 
										the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite" target="_blank"><i>TESS</i> 
										mission</a> orbit stars too faint for detailed follow-up observations. With 
										recent <i>TESS</i> observations of relatively bright stars known to host at 
										least one planet, we can discover new transiting planets and expand the sample of long-period 
										planets by detecting single-transit events. This is an important step in building up a robust
										sample of multiplanet systems that can be used to test theories of planet formation and migration.
										Additionally, as value-added, searching for multi-planet systems with <i>TESS</i> will enable us to discover
										new exoplanets that are especially compelling targets for detailed follow-up and atmospheric characterization.

									<p><span class="image left"><a href="res-hotjupiters.html"><img src="images/cloudy_hot_jupiter.jpg" alt="Artist's impression of a cloudy hot Jupiter exoplanet"></a><em>Illustration: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MIT</em></span>
										Despite their intrinsically low abundance, Hot Jupiters are easily the most well-characterized class of exoplanets
										thanks to their large sizes, high masses, and hot temperatures (and therefore high signal-to-noise). However,
										much of the relevant physics underlying these planets remains mysterious, as there are no Solar System analogs
										and laboratory experiments in this regime are difficult. This makes interpreting observations of hot Jupiters
										challenging. Mineral clouds are a key example of atmospheric phenomena on hot Jupiters that likely influence
										observable quantities (such as thermal emission spectra), yet are poorly understood in terms of their physical
										properties, spatial extent, and sedimentation efficiency (to list a few things). Several different approaches 
										to modeling clouds in hot Jupiter atmospheres have been developed that span a wide range of physical assumptions. 
										By comparing observations to simulated expectations under different cloud model assumptions, we can better
										understand the nature of these exotic exoplanets.
